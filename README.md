## Purpose
To explore abstract mappings between musical structure and physical properties in an interactive VR installation.

## Description
Floating cubes, driven by curl and gradient based noise, mirror the swirling motifs and tension of symphony. Each cube represents a single instrument and plays its audio sample only when you touch it—transforming the force field itself into an instrument. You can grab a cube and move it elsewhere in the field; its new position then modulates playback parameters (e.g. rate, duration, offset), offering an immersive, interactive soundscape. The fourth movement of Dvořák’s *New World Symphony* is selected as the audio source.
