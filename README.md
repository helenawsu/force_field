## Purpose
To explore abstract mappings between musical structure and physical properties in an interactive VR installation.

## Description
Floating cubes, driven by curl- and gradient-based noise, mirror the swirling motifs and tension of string instruments. Each cube represents a single instrument and plays its audio sample only when the user touches it—transforming the force field itself into an instrument. The fourth movement of Dvořák’s *New World Symphony* is selected as the audio source.
